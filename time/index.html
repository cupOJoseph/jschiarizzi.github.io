        Buy My Time
      </h2>
      <p>
        In a given year I will spend about 3,000 hours working on projects, ideas, and inventions. Since 2016 I have been freelancing and have built projects for individuals, agencies, startups, friends, fortune 500s, indie hackers, myself, plants, and animals. My freelancing rate is <strong>$85 / hour</strong> for any kind of development work, and my calendar is rapidly filling up for 2020. I thought it would be interesting to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-can-be-tokenized-the-tokenization-of-everything-mw1ay3bk7">Tokenize</a> my time. Right now you can buy any amount of hours of my time using Ether, the native currency of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/beginners/">Ethereum</a> blockchain. Owning one of these tokens will entitle you to 1 hour of my time, whenever you choose, in 2020. I will do any sort of development work, or we can have tea for an hour, or go make sandcastles together at the beach. It's up to you if you control the tokens. Hopefully, this will enable a few interesting things to happen:
      <ul>
        <li>My time can be sent as a gift to someone else.</li>
        <li>My time can be traded for other assets, or even someone else's time.</li>
        <li>My time is limited, and as the year goes on and tokens are redeemed || stored, the scarcity of my time may cause price fluctuations.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

        A the current price of Ether, <i>My Time Tokens</i> cost roughly <strong>$50</strong> each, with no transaction fees. A bargain when compared to my freelancing rate. Buy some before 2020 is booked and I run out. If you would like to trade some other coins or assets for <i>My Time Tokens</i>, just contact me.

        FAQ
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Why?</li>
        <p>
          For fun. To see what happens. To create something no one has created before, the first step towards a decentralized marketplace for individuals time.
        </p>
        <li>How?</li>
        <p>
          Solidity smart contract which issues 3000 (ERC-20 standard) tokens. 0x Instant, a liquidity and token trading protocol. A little bit of Gas, and some HTML + Javascript.
        </p>
        <li>How do I know you will really do the work if I buy your tokens?</li>
        <p>
          If you'd prefer to sign a contract with me for some freelancing work, I would be happy to chat. <a href="mailto:joseph@fourthwavestudios.com">Email</a> me any time.
        </p>
        <li>Can I make my own <i>Time Token</i>?</li>
        <p>
          Sure! I'm using a simple ERC-20 smart contract (from Open Zeppelin) and serving liquidy with Uniswap. If you'd like help setting that up, just message me and I'd be happy to lend a hand.
